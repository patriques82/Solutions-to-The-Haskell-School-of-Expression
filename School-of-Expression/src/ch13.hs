Create instances of Regions and Shapes in the class Combine.
Can you think of reasonable instances of String and Float?

instance Combine Shape where

-- Since Combine [a] is already defined in Animation there is no need
-- to redo it. a is a polymorphic type variable and could be a Char
-- String = [Char] => Combine String is not necessary
