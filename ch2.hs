{- 2.4
Define a function "convex :: Shape -> Bool" that determines
whether or not its agument is a convex shape (athough we are mainly
intereste in the convexity of polygons, you might as well define it
for each kind of shape.

Property of a convex polygon:
A vertex V of a polygon is a reflex vertex if its internal angle is strictly greater than pi.
Otherwise the vertex is called convex.
